## Wann?
Wenn ich <span style="color:red">im Team programmiere </span>

## Das Problem:

Man unterbricht das Programmieren an einer beliebigen Stelle und jemand findet danach nicht mehr schnell rein. 

>You need to start from a place of confidence and certainty.

## Die Lösung:

> Always make sure that all of the tests are running before you check in your vode

## Begründung:

> When you come back to the code, you then ahve an abvious place to start. You have an obvious, concrete bookmark to help you remember what you were thinking; and making that test work should be quick work, so you'll quickly get your feet back on that victory road.
