> Each of the unit tests you write... is an example, written in code, describing how the system should be used. If you follow the three laws, then there will be a unit test that describes how to create every object in the system, every way that those objects can be created. There will be a unit test that describes how to call every function in the system every way that those functions can meaningfully be called. For anything you need to know how to do, there will be a unit test that describes it in detail. 
> The unit tests are documents. They describe the lowest-level design ot the system. They are unambiguous, accurate, written in a language that the audience understands, and are so formal that they execute. They are the best kind of low-level documentation that can exist.
